Research in our lab is focused on understanding the evolution multicellularity in animals.
In particular, we study the evolution and function of cell adhesion proteins to understand how animal tissues are built.
We utilize a broad range of methods in comparative embryology, cell biology, protein biochemistry, and bioinformatics to explore how cells stick together in non-bilaterian animals (cnidarians, sponges, placozoans, and ctenophores).
