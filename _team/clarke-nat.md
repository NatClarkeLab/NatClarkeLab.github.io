  name:     Nat Clarke
  bio:      Assistant Professor, Department of Biology
  fullbio:  "Nat did his undergraduate at Whitman College, where he worked in the labs of Kate Jackson and Peter Zani studying the effects of temperature on ectotherm reproduction. After graduating he worked in Cassandra Extavour's lab at Harvard OEB, studying the development of germ cells in insects. He moved to California in 2012 to pursue a PhD in Biology at Stanford University. There, he worked with Chris Lowe and James Nelson to explore the evolution of cell adhesion mechanisms in animals using a combination of embryology and biochemistry. After finishing his PhD in September 2018, Nat moved to Cambridge to start a postdoc position with Adam Martin at MIT. At MIT, he studied how cell adhesion contributes to embryonic morphogenesis. Upon finishing his postdoc, he worked as a research scientist in the lab of Brady Weissbourd to study genetics and development in jellyfish. He subsequently began as an assistant professor at the University of Miami in 2025."
