abstract: "Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are ubiquitous tools in research, yet their endogenous functions in nature are poorly understood. In this work, we describe a combination of functions for FPs in a clade of intertidal sea anemones whose FPs control a genetic color polymorphism together with the ability to combat oxidative stress. Focusing on the underlying genetics of a fluorescent green “Neon” color morph, we show that allelic differences in a single FP gene generate its strong and vibrant color, by increasing both molecular brightness and FP gene expression level. Natural variation in FP sequences also produces differences in antioxidant capacity. We demonstrate that these FPs are strong antioxidants that can protect live cells against oxidative stress. Finally, based on structural modeling of the responsible amino acids, we propose a model for FP antioxidant function that is driven by molecular surface charge. Together, our findings shed light on the multifaceted functions that can co-occur within a single FP and provide a framework for studying the evolution of fluorescence as it balances spectral and physiological functions in nature."
