Our lab welcomes applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver or family commitment, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status. We are committed to fostering a supportive and collaborative lab environment.

We are actively recruiting highly motivated undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows interested in exploring questions related to the evolution of animal multicellularity, cell adhesion mechanisms, and embryonic morphogenesis.

Interested PhD students should contact Nat directly to discuss research projects, and plan to apply to the University of Miami Biology graduate program [(more info here)](https://biology.as.miami.edu/graduate/prospective-graduate-students/index.html).

Postdoctoral candidates should contact Nat directly with a cover letter, CV, and contact information for two references. Your cover letter should briefly describe your past and current research interests and why you are interested in joining our group.
