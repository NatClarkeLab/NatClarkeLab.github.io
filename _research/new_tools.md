A core focus of our laboratory is developing innovative tools for experimental biology in non-model organisms. We have created [new imaging techniques](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13227-024-00228-0), [transgenesis methods](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.10.022), and strategies for [reagent delivery and gene knockout](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.202857). These advancements expand research capabilities in understudied groups, and we aim for our efforts to drive progress in the field.
