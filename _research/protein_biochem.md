The genomes of non-bilaterian animals encode a diverse array of cell adhesion proteins that are structurally distinct from those found in bilaterians. In our lab, we use various protein biochemistry techniques to investigate the structure and function of these unique adhesion proteins. Our goal is to understand how their functional differences influence cell and tissue properties in non-bilaterian animals.
