â€‹Analysis of the innovations associated with animal origins has been hindered by the lack of model species in non-bilaterian phyla with toolkits for cellular and molecular biology. To address this problem, a long-term goal of our research is to develop new model species in diverse non-bilaterian groups, including placozoans, sponges and ctenophores, which represent the most basal branches of the animal tree of life.
